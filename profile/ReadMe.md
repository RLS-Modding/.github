# RLS Modding Organization

RLS Modding is a group of dedicated people creating mods, tools, and utilities for **BeamNG.drive**—with a special focus on enhancing **Career Mode**. Our goal: expand gameplay, improve quality-of-life, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in BeamNG for both players and developers.

## What We Do

- **RLS Career Overhaul**  
  A complete overhaul of Career Mode with freeroam racing, police pursuits, delivery jobs, insurance, garages, dealerships, economy balancing, and more.

- **Career Expansions**  
  Add new maps and content to the overhaul, such as the **Italy Expansion**, bringing scenic travel destinations and new gameplay opportunities.

- **Repo Mod Manager**  
  A tool to build, manage, and share mod packs with ease. It streamlines setup, fetches missing mods, and organizes collections for different playstyles.  
  *(Powered by our Conflict Resolver, which ensures mods with overlapping files can still work together.)*

- **Quality-of-Life Tools**  
  Utilities designed to make BeamNG smoother for both players and creators—reducing friction, saving time, and keeping mod setups stable.

## Early Access & Public Releases

We provide **beta access** to supporters for our early access (EA) mods.  
Once a mod is polished and stable, we **always release it for free** to the community.

- [Support us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/RacelessRLS) to access early betas and help development

## Our Promise

Every project from RLS Modding is built with these principles:

- **Free Public Release** – Most mods enter **beta first** through early access, but all are **always released for free** once polished and stable.  
- **Quality & Stability** – Designed to work smoothly and enhance the BeamNG experience.  
- **Career Focused** – Expanding the game’s systems with depth and replayability.  
- **Innovation** – Continuously pushing the boundaries of what BeamNG mods can achieve.
